# bitcode-build-tool

This is a copy of Xcode's internal bitcode-build-tool which Xcode uses
to rebuild your app from bitcode. This can be useful to call when you
want to understand what your true final app looks like.

## Update

To update this to a new version:

```sh
./update.sh path/to/xcode
```
